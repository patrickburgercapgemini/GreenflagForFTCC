A COLLABORATIVE INIATITTIVE
GREENFLAG is an innovative digital web-solution part of a collaborative initiative led by the French Tech Corporate Community (FTCC). This community brings together members of major French groups within the framework of the Mission Numérique des Grands Groups, initiated by the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Productive Redress. The objective is to encourage the emergence of common and concrete solutions for a sustainable digital transformation.





GREENFLAG is a web-application providing companies a simple and effective assessment of the environmental impacts of their digital projects at every stage of their development (BUILD & RUN). 
This tool fastens the decision-making process, especially during digital project creation, with a better consideration of environmental impacts, and so contributes to strategic plans of companies. It also provides with the ability to measure the impact of the digital portfolio of the company, allowing for better analysis and adjustments.

Thanks to an intuitive interface, users can quickly get information on the CO2 emissions generated and avoided by their digital projects, through a consolidated KPI named Return On Environment (ROE) as well as low-level analysis. It considers various parameters such as:
•	Location of the project
•	Resources allocated to the project
•	IT equipment
•	Commuting of project stakeholders
•	Data centres & network
•	Avoided emissions linked to the digital project


2021 to 2023: FROM AN IDEA TO A WEP-APPLICATION
The GREENFLAG project has mobilized several major French companies, regardless of sector of activity, with a significative engagement from Eramet and Capgemini, which respectively contributed up-to 17% and 83% to the project. 
Thanks to this collaboration, the tool has benefited from multidisciplinary expertise to ensure an optimal methodology and approach.

From 2021 to 2023, GREENFLAG has been delivered into 4 main steps:
1.	Early 2021, brainstorming on the concept of a simulator of environmental impacts of digital project. 
The concept of GREENFLAG was born, with the engagement of:








2.	End of 2021, build of a Most valuable Product (MVP) in an Excel format, aiming at designing the methodology.
3.	2022, improvement and test of the MVP
4.	Early 2023, build of the web-application MVP by Capgemini, easing the access to the tool to a broader audience.
An up-coming phase: continuous improvement of the solutions including new KPIs.
