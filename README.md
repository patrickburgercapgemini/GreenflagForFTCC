## Description of the solution
GREENFLAG is a web-application providing companies a __simple and effective assessment of the environmental impacts of their digital projects at every stage of their development (BUILD & RUN)__. 
This tool fastens the __decision-making process__, especially during digital project creation, with a better consideration of environmental impacts, and so contributes to strategic plans of companies. It also provides with the ability to __measure the impact of the digital portfolio__ of the company, allowing for better analysis and adjustments.

Thanks to an intuitive interface, users can quickly get information on the CO2 emissions generated and avoided by their digital projects, through a __consolidated KPI named Return On Environment (ROE)__ as well as low-level analysis. It considers various parameters such as:
* Location of the project
* Resources allocated to the project
* IT equipment
* Commuting of project stakeholders
* Data centres & network
* Avoided emissions linked to the digital project




  

## Context of the application

The GREENFLAG project has mobilized several major French companies, regardless of sector of activity, with a significative engagement from Eramet and Capgemini, which respectively contributed up-to 17% and 83% to the project. 
Thanks to this collaboration, the tool has __benefited from multidisciplinary expertise to ensure an optimal methodology and approach__.

  
From 2021 to 2023, GREENFLAG has been delivered into 4 main steps:

Atos, Bouygues Construction, Veritas, Capgemini, Decathlon, Econocom, Engie, Eramet, La Poste, Michelin, Sodexo
2. End of 2021, build of a Most valuable Product (MVP) in an Excel format, aiming at designing the methodology.
3. 2022, improvement and test of the MVP
4. Early 2023, build of the web-application MVP by Capgemini, easing the access to the tool to a broader audience.
An up-coming phase: continuous improvement of the solutions including new KPIs.
